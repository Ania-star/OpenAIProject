I'm your host Dr Mary Han, psychologist, parenting expert and author of the How Not to Screw Up Your Kids, a real life guide to parenting book. And I've got a corker of a question for you today and I've got a very clear opinion just to say. So the question is, my six year old wants a phone and I don't want them to have one. We keep battling help. This is probably actually realistically, you know, thank you to the listener actually who sent that question in because I think there are lots of parents that are battling with this, who find themselves eventually giving in because they don't know what else to do. I'm going to say this with love but I'm going to kind of cut to the chase. I think as parents we have to learn to say no to our children. Now the old added, oh my friends got one and why can't I have one and they can be pretty insistent. I know that they're going to say that but I mean the bottom line is we know that at six year old, well we can have a discussion about this, I'd argue still probably a 10, 11 and 12 year old. A six year old needs to be discovering and learning about the world through play. They should not be down a rabbit hole that is basically the internet and a phone. So my suspicion is with that request of that six year old in terms of a phone is probably not that they want to go on social media platforms but it's probably much more to do with being able to play games and potentially to be able to watch videos, you know, YouTube, TikTok, that sort of thing. And we just have to say no and I think we can say this in a loving and compassionate way but we can explain to our children that there will be a time, there will be an age and a stage when a mobile phone will be something that they will have and it will be a privilege and with that privilege comes responsibility. But at six years old that is not the time and whilst they might have friends who also have those, who they say have those, it isn't something that you're going to do within your family and I think we have to be really strong about this notion that we are fundamentally the CEOs of our family. We create the culture within that family. We dictate the, you know, and I don't mean dictate in a sort of a dictatorial but we signpost and we dictate the values within our family. And if the values are then undermined and eroded on the basis of basically we do what everybody, what our children perceive every other family is also doing, then it sets a dangerous precedent. There are some things that I think that we need to discuss around this in particular. The first is we have to check what are we modelling to our child. So your six year old is asked for a phone for a reason. They have seen it used in a way that they believe is fun, often enough to feel that they need it. So the first question is to do a bit of self-reflection on what are you doing in terms of modelling your use of digital devices? Now you may well have a job that requires you to be checking your emails and other things and so there's not a criticism but it may well be that you need to be more mindful and really set very clear parameters and that your children are aware that you are in work mode and you're not in work mode. Rather than, you know, these devices we tend to sort of have the omnipresent, they're just pervasive and everywhere. So I think the first thing we need to be looking at is considering what is it that I'm modelling that is giving my child this notion about wanting a phone. So I think that's the first part. Then I think the other part is then also looking at what is it that my child is spending time on? What do they believe that that mobile phone is going to replace and to give them? And then to look at how they naturally play and how curious they are and how much they are also engaged in other digital media. So for example, do you have a child who's watching a lot of television? There's nothing wrong with watching television but if you're having a child who is switching out of being curious, who isn't engaging in their toys or anything creative, isn't getting outside, isn't sort of role playing and imagining his plays and spending time, particularly a six year old, maybe doing some colouring or some creativity or flicking through a book, even if they're not necessarily reading, is really looking at what does their play look like? What opportunities do they get to play? How can I help scaffold that by getting on the floor with them and sort of starting some of that play with the toys that they already have and that creativity so that I'm helping them see the other options that they've got? Because being on a mobile phone or any sort of digital device in terms of gaming or watching videos is passive. It happens to us, we're watching it. Now yes, when you're playing a game, there's an element of engagement, but it's the stimulation is coming and that curious, that fantasy and that magic and that using your imagination comes from the device rather than from the child. So we need to sort of be getting to the root of what is it? Why is it that my child sees this particular device as something that they need to be using? Then also looking at how can I encourage them and help and support them in terms of engaging creatively with play as we might typically expect it. So I think those are kind of really sort of crucial aspects of helping and supporting them in terms of those sort of digital devices. And then it may well be that your child wants a mobile phone or wants a digital device because they want to engage in something that actually may well be something quite beneficial. Maybe they're really interested in researching about animals and that's what they're looking at doing or they want to research specific projects. Then we can talk about using technology and devices as instructive that we can sit with our children and use together because we don't want to demonize technology but we want to make it clear it's appropriate uses at different ages and stages in our children's development. Because the reality is if you've got a six year old on a digital device, if they're starting to use digital devices at that age, you're already on a very steep path to them spending more and more time on it. So I really think it's important that we allow our children to remain children and curious and use their imagination and create all sorts of imaginative play from their brain when their brain is still incredibly neuroplastic and they're still making incredible new and diverse connections. When their interests and what they play with becomes more tunneled, then the connections that then get made tend to be more narrow. And then what then happens when our children get to those tween years, between 10 when their brain goes through another big change where pruning happens and neuro connections that haven't been used begin to get cut. It's not the end of the world because we know with neuroplasticity we can rebuild connections but the rebuilding a connection takes so much more time than it does when our children are younger. And every interaction that our children have leaves some sort of trace in terms of their brain structure. And I think we should just be asking ourselves the question, what kind of neural connections do we want them to have and which ones can we just delay because they're not appropriate for that age and stage. And I think it's really important that we kind of keep that. So I'm going to ask potentially what might be a question that some of you might be thinking as you're listening to this is, okay, so what is the appropriate age in terms of children having mobile phones? And I think in terms of mobile phones that are used in order to make phone calls rather than electronic devices that they use to play on or to watch videos in. My personal view is probably not until they move on to secondary school really and some if they're not interested I don't think they necessarily need them but I think there is absolutely no need for a child to have a mobile phone unless there are very specific circumstances that they might use them in because you're away or something like that. But I think in essence children do not need mobile phones as in using them for mobile phones before they then go on to secondary school. And I think in terms of iPads being offered to children at young age those should be devices that are used together rather than individually. And I was at a conference and I was sat next to a parent who had come up with a really incredibly creative way of sort of managing and being a respectful use of iPads with his younger daughters and it was they have one family iPad and the assumption is that if we've got one family iPad which we all use, which we all take turns to use and that means that when we then each take our turn to use it we need to be prepared to know that other people are going to see what we've looked at on other websites not because we're prying but because if we share one device we're all going to be aware of where everyone else has gone. So I think that can breed a really helpful culture within the home that there is a device, the device is shared so it doesn't become a specific device to a child and I'm really I think that's a great way of managing the inevitable requests for devices when children are younger. I still would not be looking at a six year old having an iPad. I just I think there are so many other ways, other doors that get closed to how they play and explore their world when the minute we hand over a digital device. So be strong, say no, you know that it isn't going to be helpful for them and that there are so many other better quality ways for them to spend their spare time. So I hope you found that useful and as always if you have loved this episode I would be so grateful if you could follow, rate and review this podcast so that others can find us and we can spread the love.

She emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and saying no to children, as they should be discovering and learning through play at a young age. Dr. Han suggests that parents reflect on their own use of digital devices and model appropriate behavior for their children. She advises parents to encourage creative play and engagement with other activities rather than relying on digital devices. Dr. Han believes that mobile phones are not necessary for children until they reach secondary school, and iPads should be used as shared family devices rather than individually. She concludes by reminding parents that there are many other better quality ways for children to spend their spare time.", "podcast_highlights": "- \"As parents, we have to learn to say no to our children.
